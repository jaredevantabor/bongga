    mission: `Mission: Bongga is a safe space for all Filipinos seeking healthy and purposeful lives. 

    Vision: Bongga strives to make the Philippines a country where all people, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, are able to live healthy and authentic lives. 
    
    
    The call to action: By many accounts and reckonings, the Philippines is generally a country where the LGBT+ community is visible and accepted. LGBT+ individuals are present and visible in many aspects of Filipino society, and play important roles therein. One need only turn on the TV for a few minutes to see LGBT+ community members. Recently, an open trans woman, Geraldine Roman, was elected to represent her province of Bataan. 
    
    Despite these important gains in visibility, LGBT+ people in the Philippines still face systemized and structural barriers. While trans individuals are widely accepted in society, students and employees often face harsh punishments for bucking binary gender expressions. Same-sex couples do not have access marriage or other benefits associated with government recognition of their relationships. Even those characters shown on TV are typically one dimensional caricatures, who represent fictionalized embodiments of the very real social barriers as to what LBGT+ people can and can’t do in the Philippines. So despite the appearance of acceptance, there are still many ways in which things can be improved. 
    
    Bongga’s role is to provide a space for the LGBT Community to access resources, educate their communities, and find support. Many of our actions are based on the recommendations from the joint UN/USAID report: Being LGBT in Asia. Bongga works with local schools, social workers, health officials, and business owners to help make Bacolo City a place where all individuals, regardless of their identities can live authentic and productive lives.
